The transactions in this directory were copied from:

`https://github.com/zcash/lightwalletd/blob/master/testdata/tx_v5.json`

The hex data here is the first field ("tx") of each line of that file,
making the format suitable for the darkside `StageTransaction` gRPC.
The file is named by its `txid`.
